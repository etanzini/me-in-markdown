## Introduction

Hi, My name is Evan, I'm 14, in 10th grade, and am currently in one AP Class. One fun fact about me is that i play guitar, in my opinion my best solo is master of puppets or crazy train. I also like playing rhythm a lot and i think it might be better than lead. I think that lead is cool too, but theres something about rhythm that's so cool.

Over the Summer, in June, i saw Metallica live in santa clara on the 22nd. they played Ride the Lightning, Blackened, One, Enter sandman, Whiplash, Sanatarium, The Unforgiven,Wherever I May Roam, The Call of Ktulu, and more. Pantera was also there, and they played Walk, The Domination Breakdown, 5 Minutes Alone, Cowboys from Hell, This Love, I'm Broken, and more.

One sport that I love is freeride skiing, for the past 2 years i've been competing in freeride competition with IFSA. This year is gonna be my first year in U19 and I'm gonna do 3 competitions, I know that ine im definitly doing is Kicking Horse 3*. Last year i got DQ'd and this year I'm coming back for redemption.
